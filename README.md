Ms. Wolphie's AlterVanilla

----------------------

Hand crafted pack, it should be used with Optifine.

All credits can be found in the changelog and/or here, if something is not created by me.

Ressources used from other packs

Fonts : Paper Cut-Out (& Misa for enchant runes; both are tweaked to fit what I want, see changelogs)
Sun and Moon : Misa (Moon phases made by myself)
Day and night custom skies : ???? (it's something I found a looooong time ago, I didn't plan to upload my pack back then, and I can't find the source anymore, if you can help me on this, I'll be grateful)
Thanks to piber20, some custom 3D models were inspired from their own pack
